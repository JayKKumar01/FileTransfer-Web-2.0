  - Users can establish a connection by entering their peer ID and the target peer ID.

- **File Selection:**
  - Select and send multiple files to connected peers.

- **Real-time Progress Updates:**
  - Track file transfer progress using a progress bar and text updates.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
  - Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.

## Functionality

### `connect()`
Establishes a connection with the target peer. Users enter the target peer ID, and the connection is set up using PeerJS.

### `appendLog(log)`
Logs messages to the textarea, providing feedback on various actions and events.

### `showFileTransferWindow()`
Displays the file transfer window upon successful connection.

### `setupConnection(connection)`
Handles the setup of a peer connection when established. Invoked when a connection event is detected.

### `handleConnectionOpen(targetPeerId)`
Handles actions when the connection is open, such as updating logs and showing the file transfer window.

### `handleFileSelection()`
Handles changes in the file input, updating the file list container and displaying selected files.

### `handleFileListClick(event)`
Handles click events on file list items, allowing users to remove selected files.

### `handleData(data)`
Handles data received from the peer, including file data, signaling data, and readiness signals.

### `handleSignal(data)`
Handles signaling data, updating the progress bar based on the signaling information.

### `downloadFile(fileName, fileData)`
Triggers the download of a received file, creating a downloadable link for the user.

### `generateFileTransferId()`
Generates a random ID for file transfer, ensuring uniqueness for each transfer.

### `showProgressContainer(str, fileName, index)`
Displays the progress container during file transfer, updating the filename and progress indicators.

### `updateProgressBar(str, progress)`
Updates the progress bar and text during file transfer, providing real-time progress updates.

### `hideProgressContainer()`
Hides the progress container after a file transfer is completed.

### `sendChunk(fileMap)`
Sends a chunk of a file to the peer during file transfer.

### `sendFile()`
Initiates the file transfer process, sending selected files to the connected peer.

### `sendFiles(index)`
Sends multiple files to the peer, handling each file's transfer sequentially.

### `updateSender(id, progress)`
Sends a progress update to the peer, allowing for synchronized progress tracking.

### `handleFileData(data)`
Handles incoming file data from the peer, aggregating chunks until the complete file is received.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayKKumar01/FileTransfer-Web-IOS-Android.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

3. **Enter your peer ID and the target peer ID to establish a connection.**

4. **Select files for transfer and click the "Send File" button.**

5. **Monitor file transfer progress in the progress container.**

## Stack Flow

1. **Frontend:**
   - HTML/CSS for the user interface.
   - JavaScript for handling PeerJS, file transfer logic, and DOM manipulation.
   - PeerJS for establishing peer connections.

2. **Backend:**
   - No server-side logic is required as PeerJS handles the peer-to-peer communication.

3. **PeerJS:**
   - PeerJS library is used for simplifying WebRTC peer-to-peer connections.
